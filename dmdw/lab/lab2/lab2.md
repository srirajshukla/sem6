**Assignment Problem**

Creating a GIS cloud fusion table from locations present in a CSV file.



**Approach Used ** 

First I created a map in GIS cloud. Then i upload the data by importing the CSV file. I then added a layer in the data and set up the fields to correctly parse the spatial data. Now that the data has been added, we can click on individual points and get more info about those points. I then also added some more features to the map.



**Detailed Steps **

​	**Step 1** 

​	<u>Creating the Map</u> - We can create a new map by either clicking on new map button or from the dashboard. I decided to go with 	an OpenStreetMap.

​	**Step 2** 

​	<u>Importing the data</u> - We import the data that we want to fuse through either the map or layer section. We can import data from 	various sources. I uploaded the file from my computer.

​	**Step 3**

​	<u>Preparing the data</u> - After the data has been imported, we need to setup proper types for fields and the fields for langitudes		longitudes. We can also set the visibility of the columns wheter we want to show them or not.

​	**Step 4**

​	<u>Adding the data layer</u> - Now that we've our coordinates data, we can add it as a layer to our map. Click on the add layer button 	and from the database section select the table you've just imported. And new we can see our points in the map.

​	**Step 5**

​	<u>Visualizing the data</u> - We can now see the data present by clicking on the them and their details pop out on the right hand side 	of our screen.

**Adding another feature  and Analysis**

We can add more features to our map by going to the features tab and adding the data there. We can also edit exisitng values. We can also perform multiple analyses on the data

**Exporting data from GIS**

The data that we've added in GIS, added features and analysed, we can export the data either through selecting some particular area or visible areas.
